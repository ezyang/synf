[watch]
# Watch configurations are used to specify the files and directories to watch for changes
# when hot reloading the server during development

# default_paths are the paths that are watched by default
# and are defined by the language that is being used.
# You can override the default paths by specifying them here.
# These are the paths that are watched by default for typescript:

# default_paths = ["src", "package.json"]

# extra_paths are the paths that are watched in addition to the default paths.
# You can use it to add more paths to watch for changes besides the default paths.
